I am a 27-year-old software developer based in Budapest, Hungary. I currently work for IBM Cloud Video (originally it was
called Ustream before the acquisition) as a PHP backend developer. Formerly I worked for smaller companies in the e-commerce business.

I have a couple of open source projects which gained some traction over the years. In 2014, I started Harmony,
a PHP micro-framework, as soon as I realized the importance of the Container-Interop standard. Then in 2015, I discovered
the JSON:API standard, and wrote Yin & Yang; a server and a client implementation for PHP. When I realized that I could
write the fastest DI Container for PHP, I created Zen. According to [my benchmark](https://kocsismate.github.io/php/2017/01/20/benchmark-for-some-popular-di-containers/),
it is really the fastest Container in PHP-land.

Besides, I enjoy practicing and teaching Domain-Driven Design, designing APIs, applying modern security practices.
As I am fond of automation, I love Docker and Terraform too. In my free time, I co-organize the
[PHP Roundtable](https://www.meetup.com/preview/PHP-Roundtable-Budapest) meetups in Budapest.
