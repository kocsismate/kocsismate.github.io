I am a 27-year-old software developer based in Budapest, Hungary. I currently work for IBM Cloud Video (formerly known
as Ustream) as a PHP backend engineer.

I wrote some open source projects which gained some traction over the years. In 2014, I started [Harmony](https://github.com/woohoolabs/harmony),
a PHP micro-framework, after I got disappointed in Zend 2, Symfony et all. and [realized](https://github.com/Luracast/Restler/issues/330)
the importance of Container-Interop (which became [PSR-11](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/)) in its early days.
Then in 2015, I discovered the [JSON:API](https://github.com/jsonapi/jsonapi) standard, and created [Yin](https://github.com/woohoolabs/yin) &
[Yang](https://github.com/woohoolabs/yang); a server and a client implementation for PHP. Later I realized that I could
write the fastest PHP DI Container. In the fall of 2016, I finally created [Zen](https://github.com/woohoolabs/zen).
According to [my benchmark](https://kocsismate.github.io/php/2017/01/20/benchmark-for-some-popular-di-containers/), it
is the fastest Dependency Injection Container throughout PHP-land.

Besides, I enjoy practicing and teaching Domain-Driven Design, designing APIs, applying modern security practices.
In my free time, I co-organize the [PHP Roundtable Budapest meetups](https://www.meetup.com/preview/PHP-Roundtable-Budapest).
