I am a 27-year-old software developer based in Budapest, Hungary. I currently work for IBM Cloud Video (formerly known
as Ustream) as a PHP backend engineer.

I have a couple of open source projects which gained some traction over the years. In 2014, I started [Harmony](https://github.com/woohoolabs/harmony),
a PHP micro-framework, after I got disappointed in Zend 2, Symfony et all. and realized the importance of Container-Interop
in its early days. Then in 2015, I discovered the JSON:API standard, and wrote [Yin](https://github.com/woohoolabs/yin) &
[Yang](https://github.com/woohoolabs/yang); a server and a client implementation for PHP. Later I realized that I could write
the fastest PHP DI Container. In the fall of 2016, I finally created [Zen](https://github.com/woohoolabs/zen).
According to [my benchmark](https://kocsismate.github.io/php/2017/01/20/benchmark-for-some-popular-di-containers/), it
is really the fastest Dependency Injection Container in PHP-land.

Besides, I enjoy practicing and teaching Domain-Driven Design, designing APIs, applying modern security practices.
As I am fond of automation, I love Docker and Terraform too. In my free time, I co-organize the
[PHP Roundtable Budapest meetups](https://www.meetup.com/preview/PHP-Roundtable-Budapest).
